# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- (Nothing yet)

## [1.8.2] - 2026-03-02

### Changed
- Cross-device cloud sync (IPTV, addons, catalogs, watchlist, settings) now triggers on every profile selection instead of only on first app launch.
- Playback starts significantly faster — removed redundant startup buffer gate and lowered initial buffer threshold.
- App version updated to `1.8.2` (`versionCode 182`).

### Fixed
- Continue Watching no longer shows a 60-second empty gap when auto-playing the next episode.
- "Mark as Watched" from the context menu now correctly removes the item from Continue Watching.
- "Mark as Watched" now automatically adds the next episode to Continue Watching.
- Watched status now loads from ARVIO Cloud for non-Trakt profiles, so badges appear without a Trakt account.
- Continue Watching now syncs across devices for non-Trakt profiles using profile name instead of device-local UUID.
- Legacy Continue Watching entries no longer leak across profiles.
- Fixed duplicate key crash ("Key was already used") in Continue Watching row when the same show appeared twice.
- Watched badges now appear on initial Details page load without needing to navigate away and back.
- ARVIO Cloud watched data queries now paginate correctly for large libraries (previously capped at 1,000 rows).
- Hero clear logo now loads immediately on startup when selecting a profile, instead of requiring a focus change.
- Next auto-played episode no longer starts at 01:00 — correctly starts at 00:01.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Extended Live TV EPG timeline model to support multiple upcoming programs per channel (beyond now/next).
- Per-profile cloud snapshot payload maps for settings, addons, catalogs, IPTV config/favorites, and watchlist.
- Repository helpers for profile-specific export/import of addons, catalogs, IPTV config, and watchlist state.
- Expanded HTTP/HTTPS playback compatibility path for stream sources and header handling.
- IPTV VOD support for both movies and TV shows integrated into source resolution flows.
- Card layout mode toggle for switching between landscape and poster styles.
- Default audio language option in Settings with profile-scoped persistence.

### Changed
- App version updated to `1.6.0` (`versionCode 160`) and Settings label updated to `ARVIO V1.6`.
- Live TV EPG lane now uses real upcoming program blocks and only shows filler when timeline data is genuinely unavailable.
- IPTV loading/retry strategy tuned to reduce multi-minute startup delays and improve responsiveness.
- Playback startup buffering strategy rebalanced for movie/TV streams (larger startup gate + safer initial buffer thresholds).
- External subtitle injection timing adjusted to avoid immediate post-start media-item rebuilds.
- Profile boot flow now starts IPTV warm/load earlier after profile selection for faster Live TV readiness.
- Live TV and Settings surfaces received additional UI polish and focus/navigation refinements for Android TV remote use.

### Fixed
- IPTV Refresh action could fail with cancellation errors (`StandaloneCoroutine was canceled`) and not reload channels.
- Live TV timeline third/fourth blocks incorrectly showing `No EPG data` despite available EPG entries.
- Cross-profile leakage risk where addon sets could appear across profiles due to account-wide startup sync behavior.
- Profile isolation gaps by moving remaining global settings storage (`card layout mode`) to profile scope.
- Multiple IPTV EPG parsing paths now keep consistent upcoming-program selection across pull-parser and SAX fallbacks.
- Improved Dolby Vision startup compatibility with automatic codec fallback path (DV -> HEVC -> AVC) before source failover.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- ARVIO Cloud TV pairing flow via QR sign-in/register and direct account linking.
- VOD sources available inside source selection for playback.
- Skip Intro integration in player with dedicated button and backend wiring.
- QR rendering component for in-app pairing.
- IPTV support now includes Xtream Codes connections.

### Changed
- App version bumped to `1.5.0` (`versionCode 150`).
- Updated Downloader install code to `5955104`.
- Catalog limits increased from `20` to `40` entries for built-in catalogs and added Trakt/MDBList catalogs.
- Improved player startup and stream handling to reduce delays before playback starts.
- Better Android TV keyboard and remote handling in settings/addon/list flows.
- Improved compatibility for Fire TV / Firestick class devices.
- Android 7 (API 24/25) support enabled by lowering app minimum SDK requirement.
- Framerate matching behavior refined in playback flow.

### Fixed
- Source discovery regression where results became very slow or stalled after initial successful loads.
- Autoplay/source fallback behavior that switched too aggressively across sources.
- Playback start issues at `00:00` for some streams and large files.
- Large 4K stream handling and retention so high-size sources are given a fair start window.
- VOD source visibility and matching reliability, including TV-show catalog flow improvements.
- Subtitle menu back-navigation behavior (back now closes subtitle layer correctly instead of exiting playback flow).
- ARVIO Cloud account pairing reliability between app and web sign-in path.
- TV remote navigation issues in settings forms/addon-list sections.
- EPG reliability and parser flow issues affecting guide behavior.
